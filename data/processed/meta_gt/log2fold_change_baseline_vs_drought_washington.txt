The EC number depends on the cofactor: 1.2.1.24 for NAD only, 1.2.1.79 for NADP only, and 1.2.1.16 if both can be used. In Escherichia coli, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase is located in an unidirectionally transcribed gene cluster encoding enzymes for GABA degradation and is suggested to be cotranscribed with succinic semialdehyde transaminase from a common promoter upstream of SSADH [1]. Similar gene arrangements can be found in characterized Ralstonia eutropha [2] and the genome analysis of Bacillus subtilis. Prokaryotic succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenases (1.2.1.16) share high sequence homology to characterized succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenases from rat and human (1.2.1.24), exhibiting conservation of proposed cofactor binding residues, and putative active sites (G-237 & G-242, C-293 & G-259 respectively of rat SSADH) [3]. Eukaryotic SSADH enzymes exclusively utilize NAD+ as a cofactor, exhibiting little to no NADP+ activity [4]. While a NADP+ preference has been detected in prokaryotes in addition to both NADP+- and NAD+-dependencies as in E.coli, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella pneumoniae [2]. The function of this alternative SSADH currently is unknown, but has been suggested to play a possible role in 4-hydroxyphenylacetic degradation [2].

These sequences may be actual SSADH enzymes, but lack sufficiently close characterized homologs to make a definitive assignment at this time.

Both Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum have both authentic gatB and a gatB-related gene, but only one gene like gatA. It has been shown that gatA can be expressed only when gatC is also expressed. In most species expressing the amidotransferase, the gatC ortholog is about 90 residues in length, but in Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma pneumoniae the gatC equivalent is as the C-terminal domain of a much longer protein. Not surprisingly, the Mycoplasmas also represent the most atypical lineage of gatA orthology. This orthology group is more narrowly defined here than in Proc Natl Acad Aci USA 94, 11819-11826 (1997). In particular, a Rhodococcus homolog found in association with nitrile hydratase genes and described as an enantiomer-selective amidase active on several 2-aryl propionamides, is excluded here.

The enzyme complex consists of a tetramer that has an alpha, beta and 2 gamma subunits. The alpha and beta subunits have catalytic activity and the gamma subunits attach the enzyme to the membrane and is a b-type cytochrome that receives electrons from the quinone pool and transfers them to the beta subunit. This model is specific for the beta subunit for nitrate reductase I (narH) and nitrate reductase II (narY) for gram positive and gram negative bacteria.A few thermophiles and archaea also match the model.The seed members used in this model are all experimentally characterized and include the following:SP:P11349, and SP:P19318, both E.Coli (NarH and NarY respectively), SP:P42176 from B. Subtilis, GP:11344602 from Psuedomonas fluorescens,GP:541762 from Paracoccus denitrificans, and GP:18413622 from Halomonas halodenitrificans.
