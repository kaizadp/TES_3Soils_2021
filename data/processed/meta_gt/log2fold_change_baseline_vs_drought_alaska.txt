The EC number depends on the cofactor: 1.2.1.24 for NAD only, 1.2.1.79 for NADP only, and 1.2.1.16 if both can be used. In Escherichia coli, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase is located in an unidirectionally transcribed gene cluster encoding enzymes for GABA degradation and is suggested to be cotranscribed with succinic semialdehyde transaminase from a common promoter upstream of SSADH [1]. Similar gene arrangements can be found in characterized Ralstonia eutropha [2] and the genome analysis of Bacillus subtilis. Prokaryotic succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenases (1.2.1.16) share high sequence homology to characterized succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenases from rat and human (1.2.1.24), exhibiting conservation of proposed cofactor binding residues, and putative active sites (G-237 & G-242, C-293 & G-259 respectively of rat SSADH) [3]. Eukaryotic SSADH enzymes exclusively utilize NAD+ as a cofactor, exhibiting little to no NADP+ activity [4]. While a NADP+ preference has been detected in prokaryotes in addition to both NADP+- and NAD+-dependencies as in E.coli, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella pneumoniae [2]. The function of this alternative SSADH currently is unknown, but has been suggested to play a possible role in 4-hydroxyphenylacetic degradation [2].

Two species, Bacillus thuringiensis and Clostridium perfringens have two sequences each which are annotated as amylases.

Both Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum have both authentic gatB and a gatB-related gene, but only one gene like gatA. It has been shown that gatA can be expressed only when gatC is also expressed. In most species expressing the amidotransferase, the gatC ortholog is about 90 residues in length, but in Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma pneumoniae the gatC equivalent is as the C-terminal domain of a much longer protein. Not surprisingly, the Mycoplasmas also represent the most atypical lineage of gatA orthology. This orthology group is more narrowly defined here than in Proc Natl Acad Aci USA 94, 11819-11826 (1997). In particular, a Rhodococcus homolog found in association with nitrile hydratase genes and described as an enantiomer-selective amidase active on several 2-aryl propionamides, is excluded here.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein YNL292w (Pus4) has been shown to be the pseudouridine 55 synthase of both cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, active at no other position on tRNA and the only enzyme active at that position in the species. A distinct yeast protein YLR175w, (centromere/microtubule-binding protein CBF5) is an rRNA pseudouridine synthase, and the archaeal set is much more similar to CBF5 than to Pus4. It is unclear whether the archaeal proteins found by this model are tRNA pseudouridine 55 synthases like TruB, rRNA pseudouridine synthases like CBF5, or (as suggested by the absence of paralogs in the Archaea) both. CBF5 likely has additional, eukaryotic-specific functions. The trusted cutoff is set above the scores for the archaeal homologs of unknown function, so yeast Pus4p scores between trusted and noise."

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (mmsB) is co-induced with methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (mmsA) when grown on medium containing valine as the sole carbon source. The positive transcriptional regulator of this operon (mmsR) is located upstream of these genes and has been identified as a member of the XylS/AraC family of transcriptional regulators [1]. 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase shares high sequence homology to the characterized 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase from rat liver [2] with conservation of proposed NAD+ binding residues at the N-terminus (G-8,10,13,24 and D-31). This enzyme belongs to the 3-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family, sharing a common evolutionary origin and enzymatic mechanism with 6-phosphogluconate [3].
